RESTFULL API

Client send request, Server sends response

1. Server Client Architecture

    ssr- server side rendering

    Json- key value pairs(server can send data like this, client reads it and renders it on their screen)

    if client is always browser then html is better and faster, but if it is cross platform then use json.

2. Always respect all http method
    GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

    GET->get some data from server
    POST->send and mutate some data in server
    PUT->upload photo/file ie something new
    PATCH->Update existing entry
